The final product of toast cake needs to have advanced deep research, multiple reasoning models (o3-mini, o3-mini-high, and o1) 
ChatGPT said:
You're aiming for Toastcake to have advanced deep research capabilities with multiple reasoning models: o3-mini, o3-mini-high, and o1. Are you planning to integrate these models locally, or do you want Toastcake to call them from an external API when needed?

Also, do you want these models to be used in specific ways (e.g., o3-mini for quick reasoning, o3-mini-high for deep analysis, and o1 for efficiency), or should Toastcake decide dynamically based on the complexity of the task?

How can we make it 10 better than that stored local or api with options to change them on the fly.

To make Toastcake 10x better than just running o3-mini, o3-mini-high, and o1, while allowing local or API-based models with on-the-fly switching, here’s what we need:

1. Multi-Model Execution Framework
Toastcake should have a dynamic model selection engine that:

Chooses local or API-based models depending on performance, power usage, and task complexity.

Allows the user to override choices manually.

2. Model Expansion Beyond Just o3
Add specialized models for different reasoning tasks:

o3-mini-high → Deep reasoning.

o3-mini → Fast general reasoning.

o1 → Lightweight efficiency.

Toastcake-NN (custom TensorFlow Lite model) → Trained for personal usage patterns.

Vector Database + RAG → To recall past interactions intelligently.

3. Hybrid Model Execution (Parallel & Cascading Processing)
Instead of just switching models, Toastcake could:

Parallel run (run multiple models and merge insights).

Cascade reasoning (o1 does first pass, o3-mini refines, o3-mini-high finalizes).

Use adaptive model fusion, where models mix outputs intelligently.

4. Local Model Optimization for Speed & Power
Use quantized models on mobile to make local execution ultra-fast.

Store model states in RAM to reduce reload times.

Pre-cache responses for frequent queries.

5. Dynamic Model Switching on the Fly
Toggle between local and API-based models instantly.

Implement an auto-switch mode based on:

Power status (Local on battery, API on charge).

Internet speed (Slow? Use local).

Task complexity (Fast tasks use o1, deep analysis uses o3-mini-high).

Create a simple UI slider for selecting models manually.

6. Toastcake-Specific Neural Engine
Instead of relying only on external models, Toastcake can:

Train a personalized model based on user data.

Learn to predict which model to use before even asking.

Adapt reasoning depth over time.

7. Memory & Context Expansion
Implement context persistence, so Toastcake remembers past interactions better.

Store a local knowledge graph that enhances AI reasoning.

Use long-term memory retrieval to make research more accurate.

8. API Load Balancing & Failover
If one API (e.g., o3-mini-high) fails, auto-switch to backup (like o3-mini).

Choose API models based on cost vs. speed.

9. Research & Data Augmentation
Connect multiple search sources for research.

Use custom reasoning layers to enhance depth.

10. Custom Scripting Layer
Let the user script logic (e.g., “For scientific questions, always use o3-mini-high”).

Allow plugins to add new models dynamically.

Next Steps:
Do you want to train Toastcake-NN locally, or should it just coordinate existing models?

Should the UI for model switching be a CLI, mobile app, or web interface?

Would you prefer model caching to reduce API costs when switching
