Below is a Bash script that automates the installation process, downloads the model, and ensures it runs successfully.

What This Script Does:
✅ Installs required packages (if missing).
✅ Downloads the TensorFlow Lite model.
✅ Runs a test script to verify the model loads successfully.
✅ Prints "Model loaded successfully!" only if everything works.

Create and Run the Script
1️⃣ Open Termux and create the script:

bash
Copy code
nano ~/app_usage_model/setup.sh
2️⃣ Copy and paste the following script inside setup.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Define model path
MODEL_DIR="$HOME/app_usage_model"
MODEL_PATH="$MODEL_DIR/model.tflite"
TEST_SCRIPT="$MODEL_DIR/test_model.py"

# Ensure required packages are installed
echo "Installing required packages..."
pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y python curl

# Create model directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$MODEL_DIR"

# Download the TensorFlow Lite model
echo "Downloading model..."
curl -L -o "$MODEL_PATH" https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-lite-models/tensorflow/lite-model/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_float/1/default/1.tflite

# Verify the file size to ensure download success
if [ ! -s "$MODEL_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Download failed. Please check your internet connection and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Create a Python test script to verify the model
echo "Creating test script..."
cat > "$TEST_SCRIPT" <<EOF
import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite

model_path = "$MODEL_PATH"
interpreter = tflite.Interpreter(model_path=model_path)
interpreter.allocate_tensors()
print("Model loaded successfully!")
EOF

# Run the test script
echo "Running test script..."
python "$TEST_SCRIPT"

# If successful, print final success message
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Model setup complete! Ready to proceed."
else
    echo "❌ Model failed to load. Check for issues."
    exit 1
fi
3️⃣ Save the script (CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER).

4️⃣ Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x ~/app_usage_model/setup.sh
5️⃣ Run the script:

bash
Copy code
~/app_usage_model/setup.sh
Expected Output:
If everything works, you should see:

bash
Copy code
Installing required packages...
Downloading model...
Creating test script...
Running test script...
Model loaded successfully!
✅ Model setup complete! Ready to proceed.
Now, you can focus on integrating the model into your project! Let me know if you need modifications.
